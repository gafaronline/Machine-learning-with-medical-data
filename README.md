# Machine learning with Medical data 
This repository contains source code for machine learning models that were used on a medical report dataset. The performance of these models were weighed against each other to find out the best performing model and why. The models employed were, k-Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, and Random Forest. Random Forest performed the best, clearly down to it's mass iterative nature and the non-linearity of the studied data.
